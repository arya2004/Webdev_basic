        A <b>Ziegler–Natta catalyst</b>, named after Karl Ziegler and Giulio Natta, is a catalyst used in the synthesis
        of polymers of 1-alkenes (alpha-olefins). Two broad classes of Ziegler–Natta catalysts are employed,
        distinguished by their solubility:

        Heterogeneous supported catalysts based on titanium compounds are used in polymerization reactions in
        combination with cocatalysts, organoaluminum compounds such as triethylaluminium, Al(C2H5)3. This class of
        catalyst dominates the industry.[1]
        Homogeneous catalysts usually based on complexes of the group 4 metals titanium, zirconium or hafnium. They are
        usually used in combination with a different organoaluminum cocatalyst, methylaluminoxane (or methylalumoxane,
        MAO). These catalysts traditionally contain metallocenes but also feature multidentate oxygen- and
        nitrogen-based ligands.[2]
        Ziegler–Natta catalysts are used to polymerize terminal alkenes (ethylene and alkenes with the vinyl double
        bond):

    <h2><b>History</b></h2>
    <b></b>
    <p>The 1963 Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to German Karl Ziegler, for his discovery of first titanium-based
        catalysts, and Italian Giulio Natta, for using them to prepare stereoregular polymers from propylene.
        Ziegler–Natta catalysts have been used in the commercial manufacture of various polyolefins since 1956. As of
        2010, the total volume of plastics, elastomers, and rubbers produced from alkenes with these and related
        (especially Phillips) catalysts worldwide exceeds 100 million tonnes. Together, these polymers represent the
        largest-volume commodity plastics as well as the largest-volume commodity chemicals in the world.</p>
